<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<p align="justify">
This project was originally initiated under the influence of Google Developer Student Clubs and Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors - SSUET campus to teach more and more students about technology. Over the internet, there are great resources to learn Deep Learning, but what it lacks is the proper flow in their road map, which triggers the students to give up in the half way mostly.

This project is created to let student have a quickest and easiest hands on journey with Deep Learning using Tensorflow & Pytorch Python3. However, currently notebook doesn't possess any Mathematical material, but we surely be digging on it with other experienced ML writers to help through out that process.

The end goal of this repository is just 3 hours per day and only 90 days, and you will be best with Deep Learning, you may have never imagined.
</p>

### Built With

<p align="justify">
The entire project (course) is focused on Python 3. (We recommend Python 3.6 to 3.8), following some famously required packages in Python. And the most important ingredient here is LOVE. 

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Love](https://vilee.fi/eng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/whatislove-960x640-1.jpg)
</p>
  
<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Install [Python 3.8X](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/) in your local machine. Once done. Open terminal and run 
 
  ```cd
  pip install jupyternotebook
  pip install tensorflow
  pip install pytorch
  pip install opencv-python
  ```
Then reopen your termial in your desire directory, and run

  ```cd
  jupyter notebook
  ```
In that way, jupyter notebook will initiate its kernal and live on the local host.

The other possible and easiest solution is to sign into your Google Account and hit https://colab.research.google.com . This will open Colab, an online Jupyter Notebook workspace by Google. All environments are already built in, you can directly start working on Colab.


### Prerequisites

<p align="justify">
Your system must meet the requirement of Windows 7 or equivalent with minimum of 3 to 4GB of memory available.

Another important prerequisite is to learn Machine Learning. If your not currently good at it or doesn't even know a bit about it. So there's absolutely no need to be worrying about it. Head over to [Machine Learning Zero to Hero](https://www.github.com/mhuzaifadev/mlzero_to_hero)  Course, it will take you just 30 days to get best in Machine Learning. But believe me without it, learning Deep Learning is simply like learning how to fly a jet plane without learning to fly general plane.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/mhuzaifadev/deeplearningmasterclass/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).
The roadmap of this project is comprising over <b>THIRTEEN</b> sections. <hr>

<table>
  <tr>
<td> <b>Introduction to Neural Networks</b><br>
A neural network is a series of algorithms that endeavors to recognize underlying relationships in a set of data through a process that mimics the way the human brain operates. In this sense, neural networks refer to systems of neurons, either organic or artificial in nature. </td>

  <tr>
<td> <b>Convolutional Neural Network</b> <br>
A Convolutional Neural Network, also known as CNN or ConvNet, is a class of neural networks that specializes in processing data that has a grid-like topology, such as an image. Each neuron works in its own receptive field and is connected to other neurons in a way that they cover the entire visual field. </td><br>

<tr> 
  <td>
    <b>Recurrent Neural Network</b><br>
Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are the state of the art algorithm for sequential data and are used by Apple's Siri and and Google's voice search. It is the first algorithm that remembers its input, due to an internal memory, which makes it perfectly suited for machine learning problems that involve sequential data.</td>

    <b>Self Organizing Maps</b><br>
A self-organizing map (SOM) or self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained using unsupervised learning to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional), discretized representation of the input space of the training samples, called a map, and is therefore a method to do dimensionality reduction.</td>
